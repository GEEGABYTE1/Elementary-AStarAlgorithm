# Elementary A* Star Search Algorithm

My elementary version of the A* Algorithm 

`.traverse()`: Re-created elmentary A* Algorithm 

The algorithm was made using Graphs and vertices, which are Vertex objcets with a weight type `int`.

Time Complexity: O(N^3) + O(N^2)

The algorithm only takes *integer* type values as weight and vertex values can be any type.

*Note*: All other functions except `.traverse()` were made to create the graph.

Made in Python 🐍
