# Elementary A* Star Search Algorithm

My elementary version of the A* Algorithm 

`.traverse()`: Re-created elmentary A* Algorithm 

The algorithm was made using Graphs and vertices are Vertex objects themselves with single inputted integers.

Time Complexity: Coming soon 

The algorithm only takes in integer type as weight and vertex values as any type.

*Note*: All other functions except `.traverse()` were made to create the graph.

Made in Python 🐍
